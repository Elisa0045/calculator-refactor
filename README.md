## General info
The purpose of this project was learning how to use and how works Javascript in the web pages, building a calculator with the basic operations (add, minus, divide, multiply). This project was made using the Visual Studio Core for writing the code, and then I use GitKraken for save my code remotely in Github.
For be more organized I create different branches that show every step and change that I made.
Everything was building in a really friendly web page, that everyone can understand and use.
